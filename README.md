# Dotfiles

These are my personal old personal dotfiles. They are as much of a badge of honor as they were a learning journey. At this point of my journy, I was keen to using LazyNvim but not so much LazyVim and did tons of personal learning that helped with my current setup.

I doubt I'll ever update it again, but am keeping it as a memory bank and a bit for the nostalgia. Feel free to peruse, it isn't the most exciting configuration.
